## Exercise 1: Hello World

The first assignment was to learn the basic of node red. It was a simple task, with an inject node and debug print node. The inject node send a msg object with the payload "Hello World" to the debug print node. With this toolset, it is possible to debug the flow see for example what payload the msg has, after specific nodes.

## Exercise 2: Change World to Mars

In this chapter was the task to replace the word "World" to "Mars", this requires the change node. The change node can receive the msg, flow or global object and replace propeties by there name deeply. Deeply means, you can select properties deeper in the selected object with an dot. And it exists 4 different methods, change, set, delete and move. Change it is possible to search for specific string in the payload and replace it with another string. Like in this assingment, to replace "World" to "Mars", it is possible to search for other data types. Another is `set` this allows to set object, string directly in wanted property. The third is delete, and deletes the wanted property. Last one is move, to move propery to another object, like msg prop to flow or global object. To test the change node, the last node is a debug print node.

## Exercise 3: Work with CSV Data from the Web

From the USGS Website it is possible to receive the lastest significant earth quakes in the current month. To get the data, it is possible to use the request node, with the specific url. The request node supports multiple HTTP Methods also custom methods, if required. The next Field is the URL, where it should send the request. Payload field decide what it should do with the received payload from the previous node. It can be ignored, the default. Appended to the URL as search parameters (e.g. `?foo=bar&moo=coo`), the last one append the payload as the body content from the http request. To provide a secure connection enable `Enable secure (SSL/TLS) connection`, when checked it appears new field to change the tls configuration for example, when a self certificate is in use. `Use authentication` allows to append authentication data for the request, for restricted APIs and websites. It supports the usual methods ` basic`, `digest` and `bearer`. To improve the connection latency and reduce tcp connection, it is possible to use the `keep-alive` from the HTTP Stanadard, to hold connection alive. Use a custom proxy for the connection is also possible. If the website responde with a non ok status, the request node can only send the response to a catch node and not to other nodes, to prevent undefined behaviours. The last checkbox `Disable strict HTTP parsing` is required, if the wanted http server responded data is not from the http standard, often older servers. But can allow issue that needs to catched. The `Return` selection decides what the endpoint should responses, like normal string (UTF-8) or image (binary buffer), parsed JSON Object. If the Endpoint needs specific HEADERS to process the request, the `Headers` List.

To process the responded Data from the Goverment Server, that is in CSV (Comma-separated values) it exists different parser nodes to change the string in the specific format to a real object in the msg.payload property. In this assignment the csv parser node was used. It is customieable to according requirements, when the separator is not a comma but instead a semicolon (;). In the responses the frist row of the CSV is the header, to let the parser get know about this, it is require to check `first row contains column names` field. Also important is how the node send the output, each row is his own message or the complete data as an array. To process the output correctly, each row is send as a message.

The next step, the last node send his msg to a print node, to print the processed data and to a switch node. The switch node allows to continue the flow if a specific condition is true. Here it is configured to test is the payload from the msg, the property mag is equal or higher than 6. Was the condition true, the next change node replace the payload to panic and with the debug node prints it to the console.

This flow gets executed every 5 minute from the inject node.

## Exercise 4: Create a Clock with a Dashboard

Node RED supports not diretcly a dashboard, to add the feature the @flowfuse/node-red-dashboard is required. This adds also new nodes, to support to print the data to the dashboard. In this task, the dashboard should print the date and time. With the `node-red-contrib-moment` it is easier to work with date and time in node-red with the also added nodes from the package. To be notified the installation of package can also add package that are dependencies in the background if required. 

After the inject node, that get executed every second, the flow splits in four lanes. One to print the payload from the inject node, that is the epoch, means how many microseconds are passed since 01.01.1970 00:00. The second lane, supports to print the epoch to the dashboard. To use the text node, it is required to have a configured page with a group in the Dashboard Layout, that was added from the previous installed flowfuse package. Afterwards the added text node requires to be configured in which group it should appear. Also the Label for the Text and how it should be represented in the frontend, the text node use for the value the payload in the msg. In the third lane the payload, means the epoch that is only a big integer, should be formatted by `Date/Time Formatter` node from the `moment` package. The epoch is formatted to `DD/MM/YY HH:mm` the normal European standard, day, month and last year, but only the last two numbers. The time is formated in normal 24h-Format, this is by the two uppercase `H`, if there were lower case it is in 12h-Format. The payload is printed to the console and before it is printed with the next text node it get first filtered. The filter node allow to end the flow to the next node until a condition is happend. Cause the formatted payload does not print the seconds, and means it does only change every minute the filter blocks the flow until the formatted payload get changed, cause the inject fires every second but the string only change every minute. After the filter node the payload should be printed to the dashboard, also with a text node. The last lane has also a formatted node that format the epoch to `dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a`, first the day of the week then month in text, the day and year, the last prints the time in 12h-Format and the `a` is for `am` or `pm`. Without a filter node, because the payload has seconds in it and change every second like the inject fires. Also the formated payload is printed in console and written to the dashboard.

## Exercise 5: Print Weahter information to a Dashboard

Get weather informartion from an API and also print it to the dashboard, was the last assignment. To get the weather data, the api from `weatherapi.com` was used. Cause the Flows are safed in a repository in the internet the api key is not directly inserted into the flow, is saved by environment variable on the machine. To get the api key, the change node set the property `key`, in the payload, with the environment value `$RED_WEATHER_API_KEY`. The payload is send to the request node, that appends the payload to the url, so the api key is always secure. The request node sends then the request to `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?q=Konstanz` to receive the current weahter in Konstanz in JSON format. After that the payload is parsed from a json string to normal object. Then the object is send to three lanes, in the first lane the current temperature should be display as a gauge, in the dashboard. That the gauge node can work with the payload, the payload get set to the property `msg.payload.current.temp_c` with the change node. To be handover to the gauge node, that is from -20 to +40 degrees celsius configured and has 10 different colors. In the next lane, the weather should be shown in textform, for this the template node is values can interpret `mustache` code and send it to the text node. Also it wanted was two charts, one with humidity and temperature. The
